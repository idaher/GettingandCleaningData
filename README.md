# GettingandCleaningData
 There is one script in this repo, run_analysis.R. It takes in the data from the Samsung data set and creates two data sets. One, with the variable name 'df', is a data set that contains all observations as is from the raw data, only using the mean and standard deviation measurements, and combining the test and training data. The other data set, with variable name 'df_tidy', has the same variable and also combines test and training data, but this one takes the mean of all variables over each participant and activity. The script can be run as long as your working directory is the folder contained in the zip file when you download the data.
